              As mentioned previously, we've now been repairing iPods for quite some time. During this we've always been committed to using original components paired with the best workmanship.
              This means we aren't always the cheapest option available, but we feel we do offer the best available independent repair option for Apple products.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8 text-gray-500">
              We don't offer different tiers or grades of parts, only original quality, every time. This ensures your device performs just as it did before the repair with no loss of functionality or performance.
              We also ensure devices are disassembled and reassembled according to spec. We don't leave parts out, and any small components missing from a previous poor repair will be changed as part of your repair with us.
              We also replace any seals which have to be broken to complete your repair, to ensure water and dust resistance. You wouldnâ€™t even notice your cherished iPod had even been opened up as the tools and techniques we use leave no mark on the casing
