              iPatch has the ability to perform minute repairs on iPhone, iPad
              and MacBook logic boards. We have a range of specialist equipment
              along with a wealth of expertise which means we can replace
              individual chips, some as small as a quarter of a grain of rice.
              What this means is that instead of having to pay for an entire
              logic board replacement, which can be an expensive option, we can
              instead get your original one working again in most cases and cut
              the cost by up to half. It also makes for a more environmentally
              friendly impact!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="mt-6 prose prose-blue prose-lg text-gray-500 mx-auto">
            <p>
              The most common causes for logic boards to fail is either due to
              liquid damage, physical damage or overloading of power from
              aftermarket chargers. At iPatch, we run diagnostic testing to
              pinpoint the fault and would always offer the option to get you up
              and running by replacing individual components rather than an
              entire part if possible. Not only does that help you with the
              repair cost, but we also feel better about having less electronic
              waste going to landfill.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commonly seen on iPhones and MacBooks, a board repair would often
              fix a faulty screen backlight, audio issues, signal and wifi
              failures as well as complete loss of power or charging ability. On
              iPads, we can restore the loss of touch screen functionality or
              the inability to restore the device via a computer. Our steady
              hands mean we can also restore life to treasured and almost
              antique Apple products, especially the original iPod and MacBook
              range who’s life may have looked to have come to an end.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tools we use include high powered microscopes, micro-soldering
              equipment, chemical and ultrasonic baths, combined with a steady
              hand and all operated in a specially ventilated workshop at our
              Trinity Leeds branch. Since we don’t charge at all for diagnosis,
              make sure you think of us before you give up and dispose/replace
              your Apple device completely. You may be surprised at what we can
              do!
