          Here at iPatch, we serve many customers who have their iPhones, iPads or MacBooks covered by house, holiday or specific device insurance.
           Not only can we get your Apple device up and running pretty much on the spot, rather than having to send it away to your insurers for 
           the best part of a week (most likely loosing all your data in the process or having to spend a lengthy amount of time backing up and restoring), 
           but we can also provide you with a comprehensive quote to send to your insurance company for reimbursement.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mt-6 prose prose-indigo prose-lg text-gray-500 mx-auto">
          <p>
          With iPatchâ€™s wealth of experience repairing iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macs, you may even find it cheaper to have your device fixed directly with 
          us rather than paying for any expensive insurance excess amounts or loosing no claims bonuses. Unfortunately a lot of insurance companies also 
          send your device off to third parties to be repaired, to a varying degree of unregulated standards and we do find ourselves performing re-repairs 
          on devices that have come back from insurance companies only to find substandard copy parts have been used along with poor workmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
          Our device fault diagnostics and tailored quote service are completely free, with no obligation to repair. We will happily inspect your device and 
          write you up a report to forward to your insurance company containing all the device details and repair costs they require. There is no need to 
          make an appointment for this service and your insurance quote will be emailed to you the very same day, including all our company details.
          </p>

            I needed a keyboard replacement (water damage). Staff member Ben was really helpful, prompt, friendly customer service, good communication and a pickup/drop-off service during lockdown 2020.
