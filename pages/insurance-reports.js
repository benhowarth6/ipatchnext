              Here at iPatch, we serve many customers who have their iPhones,
              iPads or MacBooks covered by house, holiday or specific device
              insurance. Not only can we get your Apple device up and running
              pretty much on the spot, rather than having to send it away to
              your insurers for the best part of a week (most likely loosing all
              your data in the process or having to spend a lengthy amount of
              time backing up and restoring), but we can also provide you with a
              comprehensive quote to send to your insurance company for
              reimbursement.
            </p>

            <p>
              With iPatchâ€™s wealth of experience repairing iPhones, iPads, iPods
              and Macs, you may even find it cheaper to have your device fixed
              directly with us rather than paying for any expensive insurance
              excess amounts or loosing no claims bonuses. Unfortunately a lot
              of insurance companies also send your device off to third parties
              to be repaired, to a varying degree of unregulated standards and
              we do find ourselves performing re-repairs on devices that have
              come back from insurance companies only to find substandard copy
              parts have been used along with poor workmanship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our device fault diagnostics and tailored quote service are
              completely free, with no obligation to repair. We will happily
              inspect your device and write you up a report to forward to your
              insurance company containing all the device details and repair
              costs they require. There is no need to make an appointment for
              this service and your insurance quote will be emailed to you the
              very same day, including all our company details.
